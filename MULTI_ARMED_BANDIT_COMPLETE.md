### Usage Examples
```python
# Create optimization plugin
plugin = OptimizationPlugin()
await plugin.setup(event_bus=event_bus)
await plugin.start()

# Create decision policy
policy_id = await plugin.create_policy(
    name="Module Selection",
    description="Choose best reasoning module",
    algorithm_type="thompson",
    arms=[
        {"id": "logical", "name": "Logical Reasoning"},
        {"id": "creative", "name": "Creative Reasoning"},
        {"id": "analytical", "name": "Analytical Reasoning"}
    ]
)

# Make intelligent decisions
decision = await plugin.make_decision(
    policy_id=policy_id,
    session_id="user_session_123",
    task_type="complex_reasoning"
)

# Provide feedback for learning
await plugin.provide_feedback(
    decision_id=decision.decision_id,
    reward=0.8,  # Based on success metrics
    source="performance_evaluation"
)
```

### Reward Rules
**Built-in Rules**:
- **Success Rate**: Rewards based on success/error indicators
- **Performance**: Rewards based on execution time and performance scores

**Custom Rules**: Easy to add domain-specific reward calculations

### Performance Characteristics
